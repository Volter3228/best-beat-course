I had travelled in a few slavic countries before but Ukraine was the best experience: we were always in the university vibe, staying in the dorms, going to the special student places, I felt like a part of it all! I chose LBG Lviv in the first place, because it had a good reputation from both spanish and belgian people. They told me it was a great LBG to hang out with, plus the city was beautiful. Well, all that was confirmed when I got there‚Ä¶ I wish everyone to get to do a course in Lviv."
